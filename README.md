# Portfolio-Optimization-using-Markowitz-model
 This project examines the limitations of the Markowitz procedure due to its sensitivity to estimation errors in expected returns and covariances. By comparing it with the Equally-Weighted (EW) and Global Minimum Volatility (GMV) portfolios, we show that these simpler methods can offer more robust performance.  The project includes python codes.
